6. **Access Your Live Website:**
   - Your site will be available at:

## What I've Set Up For You:

✅ `.nojekyll` file - Ensures static files are served correctly  
✅ GitHub Actions workflow - Automatically deploys on every push  
✅ All files are properly configured for GitHub Pages  
✅ 3D models will work perfectly (HTTPS is required, which GitHub Pages provides)

## After Enabling:

- Your portfolio will be **fully functional** with all 3D models working
- Any future changes you push will automatically update the live site
- The site is accessible to anyone with the URL

That's it! Your portfolio will be live and fully usable! 🚀
